# Protocol for Curating B10K Fossil Data for Analysis under the Fossilized Birth-Death Model

## Background

- Short paragraph on analysis under FBD.
- Why is this different from node calibration?
- Benefits of FBD analysis

## The Model

- The stratigraphic Range model

## The Data

Ideal: 

| Fossil Species Name | Min Age | Max Age | First Appearance  | Last Appearance | Citation | How Dated | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pachydyptes ponderosus | 34.5 | 36 | n/a | n/a |  Ksepka et al., 2012 | All known fossils of this species are all assigned to the Runangan NZ local stage, the bounds of which are used for the age range | A morphological matrix is available for this species (see Gavryushkina et al 2017)  |
| Pygoscelis grandis | 2.5 | 8.6 | 7.6(+-1.3) | 2.5-4.6 |  Walsh and Suárez 2006 | The oldest specimens are from the Bonebed Member of the Bahia Inglesia Fm. and are from below a layer dated to 7.6 ± 1.3 Ma, whereas younger specimens are estimated to be 2.5–4.6 Ma based on biostratigraphy | A morphological matrix is available for this species (see Gavryushkina et al 2017)  |
